Software Testing

Purpose of this project is all about getting clear understanding of Software system testing Manually. 


**STLC Phases** => Requirement analysis > Test Plannning > Test desgin development > Test Env setup > Test case execution > Test closure


**1. Project Introduction** => Orange HRM application. OHRM has a Admin and Employee Self Service Module. admin module handled by HR team and each employess can access ESS module for timesheet, Performance 
                              leaves, personal details... so we are taking one ESS submodule ie My Info, so employee can be able to add modify update personal details.
                          

**2. Requirement Analysis** => In this phase we need to understand and analyze requirements from testing perspective. identify testable and functional requirements from 		                                
                           documents and parellely we need to identify scenarios.
		                       In this phase we need to prepare Requirement Traceability Metrix (RTM)
		                       
                            Required:- SRS FRS or Fuctional Non functional Doc, acceptance criteria must clear
                            Deliverables :- Reviewed requirements and scenarios, RTM
                            

**3. Test Planning** => In this phase we need to create Test plan docuement that describes scope, strategies, resources, env required for testing.
	                  test plan help us to determine the efforts we needed to validate quality of application under test.
                    
                     Required:- project doc plan, functional req srs frs
                    Deliverables:- Test plan document, Test effort Estimation
                    

**4. Test Case Development** => In this phase we have to create Detaile Test Cases from Test Scenarios as well as prepare well Test Data.
		                        
                           Required:- Test Scenarios, design doc, Use cases
                             Deliverables:- Test Cases doc, RTM upadtes
                             

**5. Test Env setup** => setup HW SW NW configuration, DB and other components required to run tests.
		                 
                   Required:- Env setup plan doc
		                 Deliverables:- Env setup ready, Env check report
                   

**6. Test case execution** => In this phase we need to find defects/bugs. we should ready with reviewed and approved Test Cases. before start executing make sure that build are ready and 
                          deploy on QA env. Run TC and verfiy Expected and Actual result
		                      
                          Required:- TC doc, Build from Dev
		                      Deliverables:- status,Defects logs, defect report, RTM updates
                        

**7. Test closure** => This is final stage of Testing where we need to create Test cycle closure report, sign off report, analyze bug and test report and exit criteria.
	                
                        Required:- Test reports, Defect report
	                      Deliverables:- Test summary report, Closure approval
